<h2>The Premise</h2>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of people throughout the US are contraceptive users, but generally, the topic is kept “hush-hush”. We talk about it with friends and peers, but the more information we have, the more informed decisions we can make for ourselves. I analyzed data from the CDC’s <a href="">National Survey on Family Growth</a> to learn more about contraceptive use in the US.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/about/staff/rachel-k-jones">Rachel Jones</a> of the <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/">Guttmacher Institute</a> provided a lot of helpful feedback on both the analysis and the story. I also interviewed several contraceptive users to learn more about their personal experiences, and I am so grateful that they were willing to share!</p>
