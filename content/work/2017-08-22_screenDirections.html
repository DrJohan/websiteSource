<h2>The Premise</h2>
<p>There have been several projects conducted that show a disparity in film dialogue between male and female characters. But, talking isn’t the only thing important to a movie. The way characters are instructed to act plays a role as well. In this project, we investigate over 2,000 film scripts to find what verbs are more likely to follow the pronouns “he” and “she”.</p>
