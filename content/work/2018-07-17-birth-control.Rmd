## The Premise

Hundreds of thousands of people throughout the US are contraceptive users, but generally, the topic is kept "hush-hush". We talk about it with friends and peers, but the more information we have, the more informed decisions we can make for ourselves. I analyzed data from the CDC's [National Survey on Family Growth]() to learn more about contraceptive use in the US.

## My Contributions

* Data acquisition and analysis
* Article Design
* Front End Programming (HTML, CSS, JS)
* Story Writing

## Collaborators

[Rachel Jones](https://www.guttmacher.org/about/staff/rachel-k-jones) of the [Guttmacher Institute](https://www.guttmacher.org/) provided a lot of helpful feedback on both the analysis and the story. I also interviewed several contraceptive users to learn more about their personal experiences, and I am so grateful that they were willing to share!
