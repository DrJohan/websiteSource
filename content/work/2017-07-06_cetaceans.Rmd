## [Read the Story](https://pudding.cool/2017/07/cetaceans/)

## The Premise

Around the world, people seem to have mixed feelings about whales and dolphins that live in aquariums. While it may be easy (and for some people even preferable) to say that the solution is to release all of the animals back to the ocean, their past makes it more difficult. In this story, we explore the data of where captive whales and dolphins in the US came from, their survival rate, and the projected timing of extinction for these animals in a captive setting.

## Collaborators

This project was done in collaboration with the fine folks at [The Pudding](www.pudding.cool). Specifically, [Russell Goldenberg](https://twitter.com/codenberg) who helped this story take shape, gave it a fresh design, fixed some of my coding blunders, and added those great videos to the first chart, and [Matt Daniels](https://twitter.com/matthew_daniels) for those beautiful geometric animals.
