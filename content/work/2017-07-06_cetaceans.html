<h2>The Premise</h2>
<p>Around the world, people seem to have mixed feelings about whales and dolphins that live in aquariums. While it may be easy (and for some people even preferable) to say that the solution is to release all of the animals back to the ocean, their past makes it more difficult. In this story, we explore the data of where captive whales and dolphins in the US came from, their survival rate, and the projected timing of extinction for these animals in a captive setting.</p>
