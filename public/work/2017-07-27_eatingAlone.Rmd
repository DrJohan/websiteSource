## [Read the Story](https://pudding.cool/2017/07/eating-alone/)

## The Premise

Americans are beginning to spend more of their mealtimes solo. What does that look like for the US as a community of people? We explore the data surrounding the dining habits and companions of Americans. 

## My Contributions

* Story Design
* Front-End Development (HTML, CSS, and D3)

## Collaborators

The data collection, analysis, graphic wireframes, and story-writing for this project came from [Henrik Lindberg](https://twitter.com/hnrklndbrg).
